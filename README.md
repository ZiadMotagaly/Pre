Number sense, the ability to discriminate quantities, is predictive of academic achievement and professional success (National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008; Jordan et al., 2009). In particular, weaknesses in mapping symbolic numbers (e.g., the symbol 2) to their magnitude representations (e.g., two objects) in early childhood are associated with difficulties in subsequent mathe- matical skill acquisition (Rousselle and NoÃ«l, 2007; De Smedt and Gilmore, 2011). Knowledge about the neural mechanisms that support number sense acquisition in children can provide important insights into neurobiological markers of individual differences in learning and inform more effective interventions. This Python script is designed for foundational number sensing. It includes classification, regression, and data visualization components, allowing you to work with numeric data to gain insights and make predictions.

Classification: Our machine learning models can classify data into predefined categories, helping you identify patterns and associations in your datasets.

Regression: Perform regression analysis to predict numerical values and understand the relationships between variables.

Data Visualization: Visualize your data to gain a better understanding of the underlying patterns and trends.
