# Niflow Diffusion Package

This is a probabilistic tractography package primarily based on BEDPOSTX and ProbTrackX2. 

The mode of execution used is Multiproc applied on slurm based parallel clustering . Hence, the package includes: 

1. submit.sh: Configures the parameters for cluster computation
2. mg-test.cfg: Configures the path directories of inputs needed for the main script. Note that the id-list has to have exactly one space charachter between each ID.
